Got it, let's structure the templates section of your testing documentation:

### Templates Section
1. **Template Role Attachment:**
   - Verify that templates are attached to specific roles.
   - Confirm that templates are deployed only to nodes with corresponding roles.

2. **Template Mappings:**
   - Ensure key-value pairs in templates are correctly mapped upon deployment.
   - Validate that the mappings.json file is populated with the correct key-value pairs.
     - Automatic population by the Python script.
     - Manual addition of necessary key-value pairs.

3. **Template Sections for Specific Roles:**
   - Check if sections within templates targeted for specific roles are deployed as expected.

### Evidences:
- Screenshots or logs indicating:
  - Templates attached to roles.
  - Deployment of templates to corresponding nodes.
  - Populated mappings.json file with correct key-value pairs.
  - Sections within templates deployed to specific roles.

These sections cover the testing objectives for the templates functionality of your Python script. Once you've documented this section, we can proceed with further sections or adjustments as needed.
