Also, add clarification in the Use Case and Requirements section stating that if the search matches keywords in multiple sessions, then in the alert it should point out all those sessions along with all the details such as the user ID, system ID, and the host name on which the login was made and what commands were run on which the keyword matched and every relevant detail associated with that. So, that is basically the requirement that we have in the Use Case.
