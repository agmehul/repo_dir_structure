- **Function:** Specifies files and folders to be excluded from synchronization when the Python script syncs content from the Bitbucket repository to the Starburst cluster.
- **Usage:**
  - Files and folders listed in this file will not be synced, ensuring exclusion of specified content from the synchronization process.

**5.3 template_roles.json:**

- **Function:** Maps template files to deployment roles within the Starburst cluster.
- **Usage:**
  - Each template file is tagged with the role(s) to which it should be deployed.
  - If a template file is tagged with a specific role, it will be deployed only to servers assigned that role.
  - Enables targeted deployment of template files based on specified roles within the Starburst cluster.

**5.4 mapping.json:**

- **Function:** Defines key-value pairs for mapping template file keys to their corresponding values within the Starburst cluster.
- **Usage:**
  - Key-value pairs specified in this file are used to replace keys in template files with their corresponding values during deployment.
  - Facilitates customization and adaptation of template files to the requirements of the Starburst cluster.
