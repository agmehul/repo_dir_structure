**6. Templates:**

- **Description:** Contains the EDP directory with template files.
- **Usage:**
  - Each template file is placed within the EDP directory following the same file hierarchy.
  - Templates are customizable versions of basic files, allowing for dynamic content insertion.
  - Customization of template files occurs in two ways:
    1. **Key-Value Replacement:**
       - Template files contain keys that are replaced by their respective values based on the mappings defined in the `mapping.json` file located in the configs folder.
    2. **Role Tagging:**
       - Each template file is tagged in the `template_roles.json` file located in the configs folder.
       - Tagging determines the deployment roles within the Starburst cluster where the template file will be deployed.
  - Template files can contain sections designated for specific roles, enclosed within triangular brackets with roles specified at the start and `<end>` at the end of each section.
  - Sections are tagged to be deployed only to roles specified within the brackets.
  - Facilitates granular control over deployment of template sections within the Starburst cluster.
