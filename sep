Here's a simple Python function that takes the path to a directory and a new name for the directory, and renames the directory:

```python
import os

def rename_directory(path, new_name):
    try:
        os.rename(path, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(path), new_name))
        print(f"Directory renamed successfully to {new_name}")
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Example usage:
directory_path = "/path/to/your/directory"
new_directory_name = "new_name"
rename_directory(directory_path, new_directory_name)
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/directory"` with the actual path to the directory you want to rename, and `"new_name"` with the new name you want to assign to the directory. This function will handle the renaming process and print a success message or an error message if renaming fails.
