To create a Chef resource that places the Python script file at the specified directory, triggers it, and then deletes it, you can use the `cookbook_file` and `execute` resources. Here's how you can do it in your recipe:

```ruby
# Place the Python script file at the specified directory
cookbook_file '/path/to/destination/my_script.py' do
  source 'my_script.py'
  mode '0755'
end

# Trigger the Python script
execute 'run_my_script' do
  command 'python /path/to/destination/my_script.py <parameter>'
  action :run
end

# Delete the Python script file
file '/path/to/destination/my_script.py' do
  action :delete
end
```

Replace `'/path/to/destination/my_script.py'` with the actual path where you want to place the script on the target node. Ensure to set the appropriate permissions using the `mode` attribute in the `cookbook_file` resource.

Replace `<parameter>` in the `command` attribute of the `execute` resource with the actual parameter you want to pass to your Python script.

This code will:
1. Place the Python script file at the specified directory.
2. Trigger the Python script with the specified parameter.
3. Delete the Python script file after it has been executed.
