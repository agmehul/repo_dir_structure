You can achieve this by using the `rsync` utility within a Chef resource. Here's how you can create a Chef resource to mirror three files from `directory1` to `directory2` and synchronize them if there are any differences:

```ruby
# Define the directories
directory1 = '/path/to/directory1'
directory2 = '/path/to/directory2'

# List of files to mirror
files_to_mirror = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

# Mirror files from directory1 to directory2
files_to_mirror.each do |file|
  execute "rsync_#{file}" do
    command "rsync -a #{directory1}/#{file} #{directory2}/"
    action :run
  end
end
```

This code will mirror the three specified files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`) from `directory1` to `directory2`. If there are any differences in these files in `directory1`, the `rsync` command will synchronize them with the corresponding files in `directory2`.

Replace `'/path/to/directory1'` and `'/path/to/directory2'` with the actual paths of your directories.

Ensure that the `rsync` utility is installed on your system, as it's commonly used for efficient file transfer and synchronization.
