You can achieve this using Python by using the `os` module to list files in the directory, and `os.path` and `datetime` modules to determine their age. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os
import datetime

def delete_old_files(folder_path, days):
    # Get the current time
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Calculate the cutoff time (3 days ago)
    cutoff_time = current_time - datetime.timedelta(days=days)

    # Iterate through files in the folder
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)

        # Check if it's a file and if it's older than 3 days
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            file_time = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
            if file_time < cutoff_time:
                # Delete the file
                os.remove(file_path)
                print(f"Deleted: {file_path}")

# Usage
folder_path = "/path/to/your/folder"
days = 3
delete_old_files(folder_path, days)
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/folder"` with the actual path to your folder and adjust the `days` variable if you want to delete files older than a different number of days. 

Please be cautious when using this script, as it will permanently delete files from the specified folder. Make sure to test it on a small subset of files or in a safe environment first.
