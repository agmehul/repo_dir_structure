In Chef, you can use guards to add conditions to resources. To ensure that a resource only runs if a particular file does not exist, you can use the `not_if` or `only_if` guard with a Ruby block. Here's an example:

```ruby
file '/path/to/output/file' do
  content 'This is some content'
  action :create
  not_if { ::File.exist?('/path/to/input/file') } # This resource will only run if the input file does not exist
end
```

In this example, the `file` resource will only be executed if the input file at `/path/to/input/file` does not exist. You can adjust the file paths and conditions according to your specific requirements.

Remember to replace `/path/to/input/file` with the actual path of the file you want to check for existence.
